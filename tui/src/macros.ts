/**
 * Macro command definitions and expansion.
 *
 * Macros are text-replacement shortcuts that live entirely in the TUI.
 * They expand inline in user messages before sending to the daemon.
 * e.g. "/go" becomes "Go ahead and implement that".
 *
 * Macros can appear anywhere in a message — start, middle, after a
 * newline — and are expanded at word boundaries. They are never sent
 * to the daemon as slash commands; the daemon only sees the expanded text.
