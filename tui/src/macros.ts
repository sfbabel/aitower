/**
 * Macro command definitions and expansion.
 *
 * Macros are text-replacement shortcuts that live entirely in the TUI.
 * They expand inline in user messages before sending to the daemon.
 * e.g. "/go" becomes "Go ahead and implement that".
 *
 * Macros can appear anywhere in a message — start, middle, after a
 * newline — and are expanded at word boundaries. They are never sent
 * to the daemon as slash commands; the daemon only sees the expanded text.
 *
 * ── Adding a new macro ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Add a single entry to the MACROS array below. Everything else —
 * autocomplete, prompt highlighting, sub-arg completion, expansion —
 * is derived automatically.
 *
 *   { name: "/example", desc: "Short description", expansion: "Full text sent to daemon" }
 *
 * To add sub-arguments (e.g. "/example foo"):
 *
 *   {
 *     name: "/example",
 *     desc: "Short description",
 *     expansion: "Default expansion for /example",
 *     args: [
 *       { name: "foo", desc: "Foo variant", expansion: "Expansion for /example foo" },
 *     ],
 *   }
 *
 * Args can nest arbitrarily deep (e.g. "/tool install discord"):
 *
 *   {
 *     name: "/tool",
 *     desc: "Manage tools",
 *     expansion: "...",
 *     args: [
 *       {
 *         name: "install", desc: "Install a tool", expansion: "...",
 *         args: [
 *           { name: "discord", desc: "discord-cli", expansion: "Install discord-cli..." },
 *         ],
 *       },
 *     ],
 *   }
